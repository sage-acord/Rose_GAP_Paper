Behavioral and Neural Response Dependency on Pulse Interval Structure
This repository contains the code for data analysis conducted for the paper titled "Behavioral and Neural Responses to Stimuli that Vary Only in Pulse Interval Structure: The Critical Role of ICNs in Advertisement Call Recognition in Copeâ€™s Gray Treefrog". While authors employed standard analytical methods, we have included details from our analysis for transparency and reproducability.
